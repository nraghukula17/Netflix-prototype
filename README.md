# Netflix Movie Recommendation Prototype

## Overview

This project implements a prototype of a Netflix movie recommendation system. It aims to address the challenge of users finding relevant movies within a vast library. The system utilizes K-Means Clustering and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to provide movie recommendations.

## Project Goals

* To recommend movies or TV shows to users.
* To find similar movies/TV shows using text similarity.
* To help users find the best-rated content.

## Technologies Used

* **Machine Learning:**
    * K-Means Clustering
* **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**
* **Python:** (Rationale provided in the original text, including:)
    * Simple syntax & less coding
    * Inbuilt libraries for AI projects (NumPy, SciPy, matplotlib, nltk, SimpleAI)
    * Open source
    * Can be used for a broad range of programming
* Other technologies may be required depending on the implementation.

## Data

The recommendation system uses a dataset containing information about movies and TV shows. The dataset includes the following features:

* `ID`
* `Type` (Movie or TV Show)
* `Director`
* `Release Year`
* `Date Added`
* `Genre`
* `Description`
* `Review`

## Methodology

The project explores different recommendation techniques, including:

* **Model-Based Techniques:**
    * Matrix Factorization (MF)
    * Dimensionality Reduction techniques (PCA, SVD, PMF, etc.)
    * Regression and Clustering
* **Content-Based Filtering (CB):**
    * Term Frequency (TF)
    * Inverse Document Frequency (IDF) (TF-IDF)
    * Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine, Decision Trees
* **Similarity Measures:**
    * Cosine Similarity Algorithm
    * Adamic Adar Measure
* **K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) Algorithm**

The prototype focuses on using K-Means Clustering and NLP. Cosine Similarity is used to find similarities in movie descriptions.

## Data Preparation

Data preparation is a crucial step to ensure the quality and efficiency of the recommendation system. This includes:

* **Data Selection:** Choosing relevant data and reducing data volume.
* **Data Normalization:** Eliminating extreme values and biases.

## Getting Started

## Future Enhancements

* *(This section could include potential improvements, such as:)*
    * Implementing additional recommendation algorithms.
    * Improving data preprocessing techniques.
    * Developing a user interface.
    * Integrating with a real-time data source.

## Disclaimer

This project is a prototype and may not include all the features of a production-ready Netflix recommendation system.
